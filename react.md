# ASSESSMENT 4: REACT ASSESSMENT
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.  

1a. Indicate which of the following statements about React are false:

- React is a modern, efficient answer to complex UI applications (true/false) F
- React will only render on the server using Node.js (true/false) F
- React is a full stack framework for modern web applications (true/false) F
- React is a flexible library that plays the role of V in an MVC framework (true/false) T
- You should always update a component's state directly using this.state (true/false) F
- React is made up of encapsulated components that manage their own state (true/false) T
- React components render HTML (true/false) T

1b. Add an interesting TRUE fact about React to the list.
React is not a framework

2. What are "smart" and "dumb" components? Explain the difference and also add why we bother to make the distinction between them.

  Your answer: class versus functions

  Researched answer:"A Smart Component is any component which manages its own state"
  "A Dumb Component can very easily be defined as a stateless component."



3. When we use "yarn add ..." in the terminal - what is yarn doing? And what file will always be automatically updated after we add a package with yarn?

  Your answer: yarn is a package manager, it used to be faster than npm, alot of files are updated including package.json

  Researched answer: "yarn install is used to install all dependencies for a project."



4. What is the difference between component state and props? Your answer should include a short explanation of both.

  Your answer: Props are passed in from the parent, state is managed by itself

  Researched answer:"Basically, the difference is that state is something like attributes in OOP : it's something local to a class (component), used to better describe it. Props are like parameters - they are passed to a component from the caller of a component (the parent) : as if you called a function with certain parameters."



5. How would you explain state to a friend who doesn't know code?

  Your answer: State is both the on and off of a light switch.
